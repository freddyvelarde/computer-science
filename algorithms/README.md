## Insertion Sort

### What's the `Insertion Sort` algorithm

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time.
It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
However, insertion sort has several advantages: it is simple to implement, efficient for small data
sets or lists that are mostly sorted, and it is an adaptive algorithm, meaning that it performs well
on data sets that are already partially ordered.

The time complexity for this algorithm is:
$$O(n^2)$$
